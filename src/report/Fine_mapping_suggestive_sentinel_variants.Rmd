# Rationale
Fine mapping of replicated suggestive sentinel variants discovered in the severe asthma GWAS on UKBiobank European dataset and replicated by meta-analysis of other three moderate-to-severe and severe cohorts. I used two different tools and compare the credible sets.

Two different fine-mapping tools were implemented, SuSiE [1] and FINEMAP [2].
<br>
For both tools, I investigated the genomic regions of 1Mb centred on the replicated variant, I allowed up to 10 causal variants, and I tested for 46,086 individuals with in-sample LD matrix created with LDstore2 [4] for FINEMAP, plink2 [5] and R for SuSiE. If a software found multiple credible sets for one region, I included all of them. If a software failed, I considered as valid the credible set found by the other tool. 
<br>
To assess the final number of variants to follow-up, I followed an approach as taken by Kanai M. et al. [6]: consider the credible set variants found in both tools; keep variants whose SuSiE's PIP and FINEMAP's PIP differ less than 0.05; calculate an average PIP for each variant. Kanai M. et al., found that variants with a consistent PIP difference (greater than 0.05) denoted poor enirchment ffor known functional annotations and more often resulted in false positives [6].

# Results


# Conclusion
Two different tools, SuSiE and FINEMAP, were used to fine-map 21 variants. After validation of the credible set I obtained XXX
